\title{Find Root Mean Squared Error}
\usage{
rmse(vect1, vect2)
}
\arguments{
\item{vect1}{}

\item{vect2}{}
}
\description{
Simply finds the RMSE between vect1 and vect2 (of the same length). 
Often, when assessing fit values, this is interpreted as the standard 
deviation of fits (e.g., vect2) around true values (e.g., vect1).
